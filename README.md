This is a C# based console application that removes the nodes not within the given range (min, max) in a Binary Search tree.

For Example: Given min = 10 and max = 15 and a BST with values [Inorder] 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35

The Output will be 10->15

All nodes which are less than 10 and greater than 15 will be removed.
